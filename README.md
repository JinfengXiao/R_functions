# R_functions
A repository of the R functions I often use.

To include those functions, use this command:

`source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JinfengXiao/R_functions/master/functions.R")`

function.R can be replaced by other file names in this repository.

## gctx_tools.R ##
This is part of L1000 Analysis Tools v1.1: `https://github.com/cmap/l1ktools`. The original file name is `io.R`. This script is used to parse the L1000 raw data files in `gctx` format.

To use: Source this script, and then use the `parse.gctx` function.
